[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) where the initial state is determined by an uploaded image (.png, .jpg, etc.). The input image's pixels will be converted to cells where RGB-value determines whether cell is alive or dead. (Live: closer to (255,255,255), Dead: closer to (0,0,0))

## Setup

1. `npm i`
1. `npm run dev`

## Plan

- Decide programming language: JS makes most sense
- Use UI framework or no: SVELTE!
- Implement game logic
- Test with image
- Implement image upload

  **DONE**

## Further plans

- Format README
- Optimize code
- Stylingg
- More options (reset state, change colors, multiple pictures?, etc.)
